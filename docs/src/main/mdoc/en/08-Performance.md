# Performance

## Compile-time Overhead

Compilation time for table definitions increases with the number of columns

Compile time for query construction increases with the number of columns to select

## Runtime Overhead

Since ldbc uses Tuple internally, it is much slower than pure class definition.

ldbc is much slower than the others with table definitions.

## Query execution Overhead

Throughput of select query execution decreases as the number of records to retrieve increases.

Throughput of insert query execution decreases as the number of records to insert increases.

â€» Not accurate because the query performed is not an exact match.
